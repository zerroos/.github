## Definitions

1) Listing: A listing is a post that informs another users that a specific service or good is available to be bid on. Any user can bid on any listing. Right now, all physical items are considered goods and should be filterable. Furthermore, anything that does not fall under this category will fall under service. The only service that are available are rides, meals and sublease. Listings have a time remaining, current bid and buy it now price field.

2) User: A user is anyone that has signed into the application. A user has a profile page, which shows his reviews, likes and listings. A user can have friends, other users on the app.

3) Likes: A user can like a listing to either save the listing for later, or 

4) Broadcast: A user can broadcast a message to his friends. This will allow one user to send a mesage to all of his friends. 

## Flow

1) A user will stumble upon a listing that they are interested in.

2) The user will place a bid on the listing 

3) If the user wins the bid, they will schedule a meetup time with the seller of the listing

4) Using the map/calendar available in TRACK, the buyer & seller will meet up and exchange goods.
